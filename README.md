# WDCC React Workshop - Starter project

I created this in the third WDCC React workshop while learning React for the first time. Lots of CSS was already given, but completed a large majority of the ContactCard, Sidebar, and ContactDisplay files. Also set the contact app up to fetch contact data off of a local host page rather than hard coding it into an array. 
Also, largely learning how to use github with this project!

below is what was given in the README:

In addition to the source code in this starter project, we'll also be using [gists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) to share code during the session.
